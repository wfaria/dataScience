# Data Science Projects

Hello! This is a simple repository to show some projects which I created while studying *Data Science and Big Data topics*.

### Data Science Essentials

A [course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT203.1x+1T2018a/course/) covering basic points such as Probability and Statistics, Simulation and Hypothesis testing, Data Manipulation, Cleaning and Visualization and Machine Learning Introduction.

I only saved here Jupyter Notebook created there and some Python code which I used into Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio.

I wasn't able to share all Azure experiments because of dataset size but you can see some of them here:

* [Adult Income Clustering](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Experiment/Adult-Income-Clustering-on-6-20-2018)
*  [Car Price Linear Regression](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Experiment/Auto-Linear-Regression-on-6-19-2018)

### Big Data with Spark
That folder contains Jupyter Notebooks which I worked on while doing a [course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UCSanDiegoX+DSE230x+1T2018/course/) from UC San Diego.

That course covers data manipulation using **Apache Spark Resilient Distributed Datasets and Data Frames using Python**, including data visualization and machine learning techniques as **K-Means, Decision Trees and Neural Networks.**
